    "# HomeMatch: Personalized Real Estate Matching Application\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the HomeMatch application, which uses AI and vector databases to match home buyers with personalized real estate listings. The application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generates synthetic real estate listings using LLMs\n",
    "2. Stores these listings in a vector database\n",
    "3. Collects buyer preferences\n",
    "4. Performs semantic search to find matching properties\n",
    "5. Personalizes property descriptions based on buyer preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The project uses a modular architecture with the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **models/listing_generator.py**: Class for generating real estate listings\n",
    "- **models/vector_db.py**: Class for managing the vector database\n",
    "- **models/preference_manager.py**: Class for handling buyer preferences\n",
    "- **models/listing_personalizer.py**: Class for personalizing listing descriptions\n",
    "- **models/home_match.py**: Main application class that coordinates all components\n",
    "- **utils/helpers.py**: Utility functions\n",
    "- **main.py**: Script to run the application\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how to use these components together to create a complete real estate matching system."
